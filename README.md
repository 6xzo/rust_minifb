rust_minifb
======

rust_minifb (Mini FrameBuffer) is a small cross platform library written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and that makes it easy to render (32-bit) pixels in a window. An example is the best way to show how it works:


```rust
extern crate minifb;

const WIDTH: usize = 1280;
const HEIGHT: usize = 720;

fn main() {
    let mut buffer: [u32; WIDTH * HEIGHT] = [0; WIDTH * HEIGHT];

    if !(minifb::open("TestWindow", WIDTH, HEIGHT)) {
        return;
    }

    while minifb::update(&buffer) {
        for i in buffer.iter_mut() {
            *i = ... // write something here 
        }
    }

    minifb::close();
}
```

Status
------
Currently Mac, Windows and Linux has been tested which are the supported platforms for now.


Build instructions
------------------

```
cargo build
cargo run --example noise 
```

This will run the [noise example](https://github.com/emoon/rust_minifb/blob/master/examples/noise.rs) which should look something like this (Mac screenshot)
